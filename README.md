# NZ-Crime-Stats

The data I have used can be found via the following links:
https://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publications-statistics/data-and-statistics/policedatanz/victimisation-time-and-place
https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/unemployment-rate
https://www.stats.govt.nz/topics/migration

In rmdfile.rmd you will see how the raw data was manipulated into the final data set found in crimedata.csv. The raw data \n
can be found in nzcrimedata.csv, unemploymentdata.csv, and migrationdata.csv. Note that unemploymentdata.csv and \n
migrationdata.csv have been seasonally adjusted. In analysis.rmd you can see the analysis that I have conducted on the \n
crimedata.csv dataset. The pdf version of analysis is the has been knitted from analysis.rmd, therefore the analysis can \n
be read without running the R markdown file.
