In rmdfile.rmd you will see how the raw data was manipulated into the final data set found in crimedata.csv. The raw data 
can be found in nzcrimedata.csv, unemploymentdata.csv, and migrationdata.csv. Note that unemploymentdata.csv and
migrationdata.csv have been seasonally adjusted. In analysis.rmd you can see the analysis that I have conducted on the 
crimedata.csv dataset. The pdf version of analysis is the has been knitted from analysis.rmd, therefore the analysis can 
be read without running the R markdown file.
