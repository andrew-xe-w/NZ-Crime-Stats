# NZ-Crime-Stats

I was interested in how the level of crime in NZ is effected by unemployment rate, immigration, and the season. I am especially
interested in validating the claim that crime rates are lower in Winter. Therefore, I conducted the following study.

In rmdfile.rmd you will see how the raw data was manipulated into the final data set found in crimedata.csv. The raw data 
can be found in nzcrimedata.csv, unemploymentdata.csv, and migrationdata.csv. Note that unemploymentdata.csv and
migrationdata.csv have been seasonally adjusted. In analysis.rmd you can see the analysis that I have conducted on the 
crimedata.csv dataset. The pdf version of the analysis has been knitted from analysis.rmd, therefore the analysis can 
be read without running the R markdown file.

The data I have used can be found via the following links: <br/>
